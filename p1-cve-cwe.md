# Vulnerability Detection in Firmware Images

## Project Description
This 12-week project aims to enhance firmware security by detecting vulnerabilities within firmware images. The focus will be on collecting CVE data, compiling projects, analyzing compiled binaries, and evaluating non-AI CWE detection tools.

## Tasks
1. **Collect CVE Dataset**
   - Gather CVE entries related to firmware vulnerabilities.
   - Collect data from popular C and C++ open-source libraries like OpenSSL and QEMU.

2. **Repository Cloning and Compilation**
   - Clone relevant repositories containing firmware projects.
   - Follow provided instructions to compile the projects.

3. **Compilation and CVE Correlation**
   - Collect compiled binaries from the compiled projects.
   - Match compiled binaries with corresponding CVE files.

4. **CWE Detection Tools Exploration**
   - Research and identify non-AI CWE detection tools (e.g., CWE checker).

5. **Tool Evaluation**
   - Assess the effectiveness and accuracy of the identified CWE detection tool(s).
   - Evaluate the tool(s) on the collected dataset of compiled binaries and CVE correlations.

## Timeline (12 Weeks)
1. **Weeks 1-2:** CVE Dataset Collection
2. **Weeks 3-4:** Repository Cloning and Compilation
3. **Weeks 5-6:** Compilation and CVE Correlation
4. **Weeks 7-8:** Research and Identification of CWE Detection Tools
5. **Weeks 9-10:** Tool Evaluation Setup
6. **Weeks 11-12:** Tool Evaluation and Final Assessment

## Deliverables
- Comprehensive CVE dataset with firmware vulnerabilities.
- Compiled firmware binaries mapped with corresponding CVEs.
- Report on identified CWE detection tools and their evaluations.
- Final assessment outlining the effectiveness of the chosen tool(s) for firmware vulnerability detection.

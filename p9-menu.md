# Menu Item Recognition from Images

## Project Description
This 12-week project focuses on developing an AI-based solution to recognize menu items, ingredients, and pricing from menu pictures. The project involves data collection, proposing a recognition method, implementing the solution, and rigorous testing for accuracy.

## Tasks
1. **Data Collection**
   - Gather a diverse dataset of menu images covering various cuisines and styles.
   - Annotate menu items, ingredients, and price details for training purposes.

2. **Method Proposal**
   - Research and propose a deep learning-based recognition method.
   - Design a neural network architecture suitable for image analysis and text extraction.

3. **Implementation**
   - Develop the proposed recognition system using selected frameworks or libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
   - Train the model on the collected dataset for menu item, ingredient, and pricing recognition.

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Conduct rigorous testing to evaluate the accuracy and performance of the implemented solution.
   - Validate the system's ability to accurately identify menu items, extract ingredients, and recognize pricing information.

## Timeline (12 Weeks)
1. **Weeks 1-2:** Data Collection and Annotation
2. **Weeks 3-4:** Research and Method Proposal
3. **Weeks 5-6:** Neural Network Architecture Design
4. **Weeks 7-8:** Implementation of Recognition System
5. **Weeks 9-10:** Training and Optimization
6. **Weeks 11-12:** Testing, Validation, and Finalization

## Deliverables
- Annotated dataset of menu images with item, ingredient, and pricing details.
- Proposed method documentation and rationale for the chosen recognition approach.
- Implemented recognition system capable of accurately identifying menu items, extracting ingredients, and recognizing pricing.
- Test results showcasing the accuracy and performance metrics of the developed solution.

## Additional Considerations
- Ethical considerations regarding data privacy and handling of sensitive information in menu images should be adhered to.
- Flexibility in the project timeline might be required based on the complexity of the recognition system and training requirements.

# Adversarial Attacks Against Generative AIs such as ChatGPT

## Project Description
This project plan lays out the step-by-step process for detecting vulnerabilities in firmware images, including data collection, tool evaluation, and the intended timeline for completion. Adjustments can be made based on the progress and outcomes at each stage.
This project spans 12 weeks and focuses on exploring and understanding adversarial attacks specifically targeted at generative AIs such as ChatGPT. The aim is to study vulnerabilities, develop attack strategies, and propose defense mechanisms to enhance the robustness of these models against adversarial manipulation.

## Tasks
1. **Research Adversarial Attacks**
   - Study existing adversarial attack techniques against generative AIs.
   - Analyze vulnerabilities in models like ChatGPT to adversarial inputs.

2. **Development of Attack Strategies**
   - Design and implement adversarial attacks targeting generative AI models.
   - Experiment with various attack scenarios and inputs to assess vulnerabilities.

3. **Evaluation of Attack Impact**
   - Measure the impact of adversarial inputs on model behavior and output quality.
   - Document the success rate and effectiveness of different attack strategies.

4. **Defense Mechanisms Development**
   - Devise defense mechanisms to mitigate adversarial attacks.
   - Implement and test these defenses against the previously developed attack strategies.

5. **Evaluation of Defense Strategies**
   - Assess the efficacy of defense mechanisms against adversarial inputs.
   - Measure the success rate of defenses in protecting generative AI models.

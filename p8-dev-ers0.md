# ERS0 - Firmware Software Bill of Material (SBOM) Analysis Platform Development

## Project Description
This project spans 12 weeks and focuses on the development of a Firmware SBOM Analysis Platform. The existing system is built using Python, Docker Compose, Socket.IO, React, Chakra UI, and PyTorch. Students will contribute to the project using an agile development process, delivering tested features every three weeks. Scrum meetings will be held weekly to decide on tasks and ensure project alignment.

## Tasks
1. **Platform Familiarization**
   - Students familiarize themselves with the existing platform's architecture and functionality.

2. **Scrum Meetings Setup**
   - Establish a regular schedule for weekly scrum meetings.
   - Define roles and responsibilities within the development team.

3. **Feature Planning and Prioritization**
   - Collaboratively decide on features to be implemented during the 12-week period.
   - Prioritize features based on project goals and stakeholder needs.

4. **Agile Development Sprints (Weeks 1-3)**
   - Implement and test the first set of features as decided during the initial scrum meeting.

5. **Sprint Review and Planning (Week 4)**
   - Review the completed features.
   - Plan the next set of features for the next sprint.

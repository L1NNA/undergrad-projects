# AI for Swarm Counter-Swarms 

## Project Objective
The project aims to develop a simulated environment for testing and refining an intelligent drone swarm AI algorithm. The objective is to create a network of smaller drones that can detect, intercept, and neutralize incoming swarms of hostile UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems). This simulation will employ swarm intelligence algorithms to effectively neutralize threats.

## Tasks
1. **Simulator Development**
   - Research existing drone simulation platforms.
   - Select or develop a simulation environment conducive to drone swarm interactions.
   
2. **Drone Swarm AI Algorithm Design**
   - Design an AI algorithm for intelligent patrolling and threat detection.
   - Implement swarm intelligence algorithms for collective decision-making.

3. **Detection and Neutralization Protocols**
   - Define protocols for detecting incoming hostile UAS.
   - Develop algorithms for intercepting and neutralizing threats.

4. **Simulation Implementation**
   - Integrate the developed AI algorithm into the chosen simulator.
   - Create scenarios to simulate incoming hostile UAS and test the counter-swarm's response.

5. **Algorithm Refinement and Testing**
   - Refine the AI algorithm based on simulation outcomes and performance.
   - Test the counter-swarm in various scenarios to assess its effectiveness and efficiency.

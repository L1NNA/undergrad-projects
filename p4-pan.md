# Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for CAN Bus in Automobiles

## Project Description
This 12-week project aims to develop an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) specifically tailored for the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus in automobiles. The project involves designing algorithms, implementing monitoring mechanisms, and testing for anomalous behavior detection within the CAN bus system.

## Tasks
1. **Understanding CAN Bus Communication**
   - Study the protocol and communication mechanisms of the CAN bus in automobiles.
   
2. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - Gather CAN bus data for normal operational behavior.
   - Preprocess and label the collected data for training purposes.

3. **Algorithm Development**
   - Design and develop anomaly detection algorithms suitable for CAN bus data.
   - Implement machine learning (ML) or statistical models for anomaly detection.

4. **Prototype Implementation**
   - Create a prototype IDS system integrating the developed algorithms.
   - Establish a monitoring setup for real-time CAN bus data analysis.

5. **Testing and Evaluation**
   - Test the IDS prototype using various simulated and real-world scenarios.
   - Evaluate the system's performance in detecting and alerting for anomalies.

6. **Optimization and Refinement**
   - Refine the IDS algorithms based on test results and performance feedback.
   - Optimize the system for efficiency and accuracy in anomaly detection.

# AI for Video-Based Counter Uncrewed Aerial Systems Concept Development

## Project Description
This 12-week project focuses on leveraging AI for the development of a video-based system to counter uncrewed aerial systems (UAS). The project aims to collect data from open-source repositories, utilize machine learning algorithms, and develop a concept for identifying and countering UAS through video analysis.

## Tasks
1. **Data Collection from Open-Source Repositories**
   - Gather video datasets related to UAS from open-source repositories.
   - Curate a diverse dataset encompassing various UAS scenarios and environments.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Preprocessing**
   - Perform EDA on the collected video dataset to understand characteristics and challenges.
   - Preprocess the data, including normalization, frame extraction, and labeling.

3. **Machine Learning Model Development**
   - Explore and implement machine learning algorithms suitable for video analysis and UAS detection.
   - Train models on the preprocessed dataset for UAS identification.

4. **Concept Development for Counter UAS**
   - Devise a concept using AI-based video analysis for countering UAS threats.
   - Design strategies for UAS identification, tracking, and potential countermeasures.

5. **Prototype Development and Testing**
   - Develop a prototype system implementing the concept for video-based UAS detection and countermeasures.
   - Test the prototype using simulated and real-world scenarios.

# Firmware Catalogue Development

## Project Description
This project spans 12 weeks and focuses on creating crawlers to collect commercial firmware images for the purpose of building a comprehensive firmware catalogue.

## Tasks
1. **Research and Planning**
   - Study the landscape of commercial firmware and identify target sources.
   - Define criteria for selecting firmware images to include in the catalogue.

2. **Crawler Development**
   - Design and develop web crawlers or scraping tools to gather firmware images.
   - Ensure compliance with legal and ethical guidelines while collecting data.

3. **Data Collection and Storage**
   - Implement mechanisms to store collected firmware images securely.
   - Organize data according to metadata (e.g., version, manufacturer, release date).

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Implement checks to ensure collected firmware images are complete and unaltered.
   - Develop validation processes to verify the integrity of the collected data.

5. **Catalogue Interface**
   - Create an interface or database structure for easy access and searchability of firmware images.
   - Implement functionalities for filtering and categorizing firmware based on different parameters.

## Timeline (12 Weeks)
1. **Weeks 1-2:** Research and Planning
2. **Weeks 3-4:** Crawler Development
3. **Weeks 5-6:** Data Collection and Storage Implementation
4. **Weeks 7-8:** Quality Assurance Setup
5. **Weeks 9-10:** Catalogue Interface Development
6. **Weeks 11-12:** Testing, Optimization, and Finalization

## Deliverables
- Functional crawlers capable of collecting commercial firmware images.
- A well-organized database or storage system for collected firmware data.
- User-friendly interface allowing easy access and search functionalities.
- Documentation outlining the processes, guidelines, and considerations for maintaining and updating the firmware catalogue.

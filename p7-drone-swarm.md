   - Study and understand the functioning of drone swarm algorithms.
   - Identify key parameters and behaviors influencing swarm coordination.

2. **AI-Based Attack Development**
   - Devise AI-driven attack strategies targeting swarm algorithms.
   - Implement attack scenarios using AI models to disrupt swarm coordination.

3. **Simulation Environment Setup**
   - Create a simulation environment mimicking real-world drone swarm scenarios.
   - Integrate AI-based attack models into the simulation.

4. **Attack Execution and Impact Assessment**
   - Execute AI-driven attacks within the simulation environment.
   - Evaluate the impact of attacks on swarm behavior, coordination, and security.

5. **Countermeasure Exploration**
   - Research and develop potential countermeasures against AI-driven attacks on drone swarms.
   - Test and evaluate the effectiveness of proposed countermeasures.
